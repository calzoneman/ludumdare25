Earthmageddon was created and tested with Python 2.7.  See
http://www.python.org for information on downloading and installing Python.
Most *nix distributions have python in their package repositories.

Earthmageddon was built with the Pygame library.  For information on
installing this library, see http://www.pygame.org/news.html

To run Earthmageddon, either run the executable ./destroy.py (assuming
/usr/bin/env python evaluates to your Python 2 executable), or run
python destroy.py.

The object of the game is to destroy the world.  Shooting at the world will
destroy chunks of it.  When all chunks are destroyed, the game is over and
you win.  Every several seconds, the world will regenerate a layer past your
deepest hit.  Enemies will spawn (red triangles) and shoot at you.  Avoid
their bullets, or else you'll lose health and die.  Colliding with an enemy
will kill the enemy and inflict 5 damage on yourself.  You have 2 lives,
each with 20 health (bullets do 1 damage each).  Enemies have 5 health.  If
you die, you will respawn after 3 seconds.

To move, use WASD.  Click the left mouse button to fire.  Click and hold
to fire repeatedly.  The direction of the emitted bullets is decided by
the position of the mouse cursor relative to your character (the UFO).
